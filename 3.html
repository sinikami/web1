      <h1>What is JavaScript ? </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>JavaScript (JS) </strong>is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language
        with
        first-class
        functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
        also
        use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
        programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or
        other host environments. For information about APIs specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older
        browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version
        of
        ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6.
        Since
        then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version,
        which is currently ECMAScript 2020.

        Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or
        registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have
        very
        different syntax, semantics, and uses.
