    <h1>What is web? </h1>
    <h2>Web이란 무엇인가? </h2>

    <p>
      <strong> World Wide Web (WWW)</strong> was created in 1990 by the British CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee.[3] On 30
      April 1993,
      CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone.[4] Before the introduction of HTML and
      HTTP, other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual
      files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure which the user navigates and where they
      choose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting, or were
      encoded in word processor formats.
